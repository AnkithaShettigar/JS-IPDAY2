    <h1>JS-Interview Preparation DAY2</h1>
    <h4>1.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</h4>
    <p>call(),apply(),bind() in javascript</p>
    <p>These are just different ways of invoking or calling a function</p>
    <p>when your calling a function using any of these 3 then we don't have to define in the function that it will be taking obj as a parameter</p>
    <p>It will assure that the first argument which is coming while calling the function will be an object only.</p>
    <p>call():In this case of call each and every argument which is required to be passed to th function will be passed individually</p>
    <p>apply():In case of apply each and every argument which is required to be passed to the function will be passed inside an array</p>
    <p>bind():In case of bind ,it will return yo a new function.And this new function you can use anytime anywhere.
    </p>
    <h4>2.What are objects in javascript?</h4>
    <p>Objects are the non-primitive datatypes and are use to store mutiple data in the form of key value pairs</p>
    <h4>3.What are function constructors?</h4>
    <p>Function costructor is kind of regular function to create multiple objects at a time.When creating function costructor,it is good practice to keep the first ltter of the name,capital.</p>
    <p>new keyword is mandatory to be used with function constructor.</p>
    <h4>4.Explain prototypes</h4>
    <h4>5.What is prototype chain</h4>
    <p>Basically it is object only ,it is present inside object that we will be creating expicitly.</p>
    <h4>6.Give an example of inheritance using function constructor</h4>
    <p>Inheritance is browing the method and properties of some object, able to use in the same way as the prototype.Basically it inherit the values of parent object</p>
    <h4>7.What are callbacks?</h4>
    <p>Function which is passed as argument to another function.Call back called after certain period of time</p>
    <p>setTimeout and setInteval are the examples of callback function which will called after certain interval of time.To perform Asynchronous behaviour callback function is used</p>
    <p>The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language.That means instead of waiting for a response javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.Lets's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout and the next function which logs the message.</p>
    <h4>8.What is the use of setTimeout</h4>
    <p>The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression 'after' a specified number of milliseconds.For example,let's log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method</p>    
    <h4>9.What are pure functions?</h4>
    <p>Use to give consistence result.A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state or data change during a program's execution. Rather, it only depends on its input arguments.</p>
